# Create a Twitter account

Create an author account on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) as early as possible to establish
a consistent media presence. Doing it too lake looks like craven commercialism. If your personal
Twitter account is light on controversy feel free to use it. 

## Help! I don't know what to tweet about!

Remember your goal is to build a community of a 1,000 hardcore fans. They're interested in your artistic life. 
So you can tweet about:

* Possible character arcs
* Mentions of any updates to your web series, press releases, Facebook posts, etc.
* Interesting writer/reader communities you've discovered 
* Artists you're evaluating for a cover
* Ideas for a series
* Other authors you've discovered on sites like [GoodRead](https://www.goodreads.com) and [WattPad](https://www.wattpad.com).
