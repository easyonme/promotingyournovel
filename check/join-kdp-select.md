# Join KDP Select

Assuming your are publishing your first book but have limited time and resources, you should join Amazon's [KDP Select](https://kdp.amazon.com/select) program. 
(See "Reasons KDB Select may not work for you" below if it's not your first book).

At least 30 days before publication, you need to join the [KDP Select](https://kdp.amazon.com/select) program. It requires
that you publish exclusively on Amazon for fixed enrollment period 
(currently [90 days](https://kdp.amazon.com/help?topicId=A34IQ0W14ZKXM9)), after which you can use other sites
to publish.

Here's why KDB Select makes sense for first-time authors

## Reasons to use KDP Select

* You get to enjoy Amazon's [free book promotions](https://kdp.amazon.com/help?topicId=A34IQ0W14ZKXM9), which offer the best way to get early exposure and reviews. These are essential for the first
time author. Using other book promotion sites in addition to KDP Select gives you a force multiplier for your publicity efforts, expanding
the reach of your audience
* You can use either [Kindle Countdown Deals](https://kdp.amazon.com/help?topicId=A3288N75MH14B8), to let you discount your book for a fixed period, 
which tends to attrack readers becaus of the perceived scarcity
* You get paid when people borrow your book (free to them) through the [KDB Select Global Fund](https://kdp.amazon.com/help?topicId=AI3QMVN4FMTXJ).
The more they read, the more you get paid

## Reasons KDP Select may not work for you

* It prevents you from working with other publishers during the exclusivity period. Practically speaking this isn't a 
huge problem because Amazon owns an estimated 90+ percent of the online book market.
* It's not your first book. [Joanna Penn](http://www.thecreativepenn.com/2014/08/30/exclusivity/) makes a strong case 
for using KDP Select only for your first book. Later you can [mail your list](create-a-mailing-list.md) to launch your
book, and take advantage of other self publishing options like Smashwords, Kobo, and so on.
