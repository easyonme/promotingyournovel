# Add a page to your book requesting they review it

People don't naturally leave book reviews. One of the best ways to change their behavior is, 
as any good salesperson knows to... drum roll please... ask for it!

On the last page of your book, add a brief note telling them to review the book if they enjoyed it.
At some point you may well use another marketplace besides Amazon. If you do, update this page to 
mention the other marketplaces as well.
