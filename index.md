You've written your novel. 

You're going to self-publish online.

Now what? Simple. Knock each item off the [Checklist](check) in order. Most of these methods are free, but timing is sometimes important. For example, you will assuredly want to take advantage of [KDP Select](check/join-kdp-select)'s [Free Book Promotions](https://kdp.amazon.com/help/topic/A34IQ0W14ZKXM9). There are plenty of other authors taking advantage of this marketing bonanza, so you'll want to amplify it by coordinating with websites that promote these giveaways. Some of them require at least 30 days' advanance notice, so you have to plan ahead.

## I'm ready to self-publish, but I'm not sure what platform to use

Not sure about which platform to use? The most popular are [Kindle Direct Publishing](https://kdp.amazon.com), [CreateSpace](https://www.createspace.com), and [SmashWords](https://www.smashwords.com). Because of its gigantic market share and unparalleled free resources, Kindle publishing is the primary focus of this site.

Understand that you can use more than one platform at a time, but there's a wrinkle. You can't use the special  [KDP Select](check/join-kdp-select) promotions while your book is on other platforms. If this is your first book, it is probably better to start with KDP Select, then branch out to the other platforms later.

Enough reading! Take some action and hit that [Checklist](check) right now!
