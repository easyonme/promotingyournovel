You've written your novel. 
You're going to self-publish online, 
probably using [Kindle Direct Publishing](https://kdp.amazon.com), [CreateSpace](https://www.createspace.com), or [SmashWords](https://www.smashwords.com).

Now what? This free site's purpose is to help make your book famous, spending as little time and money as possible. The order you do some things is important, so remember to visit the [Timeline](timeline.md). Another way to look at this is to knock each item off the [Checklist](checklist) as shown.
