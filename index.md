You've written your novel. 

You're going to self-publish online.

Now what? Simple. Writing novels is hard. **The goal of this site is to show you how to market your book as cheaply as possible with as little work or learning as possible.** Its goal is to save you 80% of the time you'd otherwise spend learning secondary, useless skills like what to Tweet when, and in what order.

Had enough chatter? Great! Skip the rest of this page. Knock each item off the [Checklist](check) in order. 

## How much does this cost? Why are you telling me when I have to do things?

This site is free. It's a service for people who don't want to reinvent the wheel. Learning all this stuff was a pain, so why not bottle it and give it away?

Most of the methods described are free, but timing is sometimes important. For example, you will assuredly want to take advantage of [KDP Select](check/join-kdp-select)'s [Free Book Promotions](https://kdp.amazon.com/help/topic/A34IQ0W14ZKXM9). There are plenty of other authors doing the same. You'll want to amplify it by coordinating with websites that promote these giveaways. Some of them require at least 30 days' advanance notice, so you have to plan ahead.

A few things cost money (none of it goes to me). You can skip them if you wish.

## I'm ready to self-publish, but I'm not sure what platform to use

Not sure about which platform to use? The most popular are [Kindle Direct Publishing](https://kdp.amazon.com), [CreateSpace](https://www.createspace.com), and [SmashWords](https://www.smashwords.com). Because of its gigantic market share and unparalleled free resources, Kindle publishing is the primary focus of this site.

Understand that you can use more than one platform at a time, but there's a wrinkle. You can't use the special  [KDP Select](check/join-kdp-select) promotions while your book is on other platforms. If this is your first book, it is probably better to start with KDP Select, then branch out to the other platforms later.

Enough reading! Take some action and hit that [Checklist](check) right now!
