## Why self publish?

Self-publishing your book gives you a better royalty rate and more control over your book's fate. The dirty truth is that traditional publishers almost never know how to make a book a hit unless they've signed an established writer. They give up pretty fast if the book doesn't become an instant success. You have the ability to build a custom audience over time and give your book a much longer lifespan.
