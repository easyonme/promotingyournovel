# Using Scrivener with MultiMarkdown (MMD) files

This is a pretty specialized article for people who wrote, or plan to write, their novel using 
[Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) and MultiMarkdown files (which end in `.mmd`). 
What follows is a tiny, inadequate overview of what MultiMarkdown

MultiMarkdown files are nothing but plain, slightly ugly-looking text files that look something like this:

```
# Chapter 1

She was not where she expected to be. That much was clear.

```

When "compiled" (which is the way Scrivener converts your files to ebook form) the `#` character
on its own line, followed by a space, followed by text, gets converted to an HTML `<h1>` header tag,
two `##` characters using the same convention get converted to an HTML `<h2>` header tag, and so on.
