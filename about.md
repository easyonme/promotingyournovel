# About PromotingYourNovel.com aka {{ page.title }}

You've written your novel. 
You're going to self-publish ([why self-publish?](faq#why-self-publish)),
probably using [Kindle Direct Publishing](https://kdp.amazon.com), [CreateSpace](https://www.createspace.com), or [SmashWords](https://www.smashwords.com).

Now what? This site's purpose is to help make your book famous, spending as little time and money as possible. The order you do some things is important, so remember to visit the [Timeline](./timeline.md).


This is a guide to promoting your novel online with the least expenditure of time, money, and trouble. 
It's an opinionated guide, meaning it makes a lot of decisions for you. I assume you'd rather be
writing than reinventing the wheel by revisiting whether SmashWords is better than Kobo or whatever.
